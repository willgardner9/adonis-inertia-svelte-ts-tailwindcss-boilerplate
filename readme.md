# ðŸª´ AdonisJS x Inertia.js x Svelte x Typescipt Boilerplate

This repo is configured with:

---

### [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/): A fully featured web framework for Node.js

> AdonisJS includes everything you need to create a fully functional web app or an API server. So stop wasting hours downloading and assembling hundreds of packages â€” Use AdonisJS and be productive from day one.

---

### [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/): The modern monolith

> Inertia.js lets you quickly build modern single-page React, Vue and Svelte apps using classic server-side routing and controllers.

---

### [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/): Cybernetically enhanced web apps

> Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.

> Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.

---

### [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.

> TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

---

### [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.

> A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
